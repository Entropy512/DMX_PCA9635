DMX-to-I2C bridge, initially intended to support the NXP PCA9635 16-channel dimmer ICs

DMX code based on Henne's DMX reception code from http://www.hoelscher-hi.de/hendrik/english/ressources.htm

Targeted at Atmel ATMegaXX8 microcontrollers with a 16 MHz external crystal.  (i.e. Arduino hardware)

Uploading this via the Arduino bootloader is UNTESTED - I use a USBTinyISP from Adafruit:

TODO:
Programmable DMX start address (currently hardcoded)
Programmable I2C address for PCA9635 (currently hardcoded)
Support for multiple PCA9635s
